# Presentation.D3

This is the presentation files and demos for the presentation **Better and more fun applications with D3.js**

## Abstract

Have you ever built an application where 99% was tables and forms? Have you ever felt that this is a little bit
boring and wished that there was a more fun way to solve this?

D3.js is a powerful JavaScript library to visualize and interact with data in a simple yet powerful way. In 10 minutes
Joakim will give you an introduction to how to get started and give you some examples of how you can use D3 to make
your applications better and more fun to use.

The final components are available as jQuery UI Widgets.

## Known issues

* The presentation crashes Safari for iPad.
* The presentation doesn't work in Internet Explorer and Opera.
* The presentation doesn't look good in Firefox.
* The source code doesn't show in Chrome unless served from a web server.

Long story short: It's made for Safari, I present it using Safari so Safari is probably the best
way to watch this presentation :-) Maybe I'll fix it in the future, maybe not.
